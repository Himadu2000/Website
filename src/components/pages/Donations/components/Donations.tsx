    <p>
      I would really like have any donations for my efforts and endures,
      personally I don't use any donations for my personal work and will be
      donated as charity! But any help is always encourages me! But money is not
      always or anyway valuable, The valuble thing s your time and mind!
      Therefore the best way to help me is to be a partner in any of my project
      or works and anyone are welcome. If you want to be that person who ever
      you are you can email me with some details about your self!
